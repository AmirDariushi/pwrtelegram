This repository contains the source code fo the pwrtelegram API, a wrapper for the official telegram bot api that supports all of the official telegram api methods and uploading and downloading of big files.


To use it simply subsitute the url of the bot telegram api (https://api.telegram.org) with the url of the pwrtelegram api (https://api.pwrtelegram.xyz) in your telegram client.

You can use this command to do it:

sed 's/api\.telegram\.org/api\.pwrtelegram\.xyz/g' client.py

For now only getUpdates fetching method is supported.

Please note that this api is still in beta and supports all of the official telegram api methods and only downloading of big files. Uploading (of big files, small files are still uploadable) will be added by the end of this week.
